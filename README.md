📊 COHORT ANALYSIS PROJECT

Understanding Retention, Campaign Impact, and Business Sustainability

NOTE: This is a dataset developed by CHATCPT


🔍 FRAMEWORK USED

This analysis follows a simple but powerful decision framework:

What happened?

Was it good or bad?

What should we do about it?

The dataset was analyzed across five core areas to reflect real-world business behavior.

A. WHAT HAPPENED
1. Trend Analysis

Across all cohorts, retention decreased by approximately 10% every month.
This translates to an average loss of 10,000 users per month.

The decline is consistent across cohorts, indicating a systemic issue rather than a one-off anomaly.

2. Identifying High-Value Customers

The analysis shows that walk-in users (non-campaign users) are the highest-value customers.

Compared to campaign-driven users, walk-ins:

Use the product more frequently

Stay active for longer periods

Show stronger long-term engagement

This suggests that organic acquisition is bringing in better-fit users.

3. Measuring Campaign Effectiveness

Three campaigns were evaluated.

Campaigns successfully drove user acquisition across all months

One campaign (Campaign A) showed strong first-month retention

However, retention drops sharply after Month 1 for campaign users

This indicates that campaigns are effective at acquisition, but weak at long-term retention.

4. Tracking Customer Changes

User count declines every month across all cohorts, regardless of acquisition source.

This confirms that churn is persistent and ongoing, not isolated to a specific cohort, campaign, or event.

5. Forecasting Business Performance

Based on the observed trend:

A 10% monthly decline is being consistently maintained

If no changes are made, this pattern will continue

This trajectory is not sustainable for the business in the long term.

B. WAS IT GOOD OR BAD?

❌ What’s Bad

Users are dropping every month

Retention remains weak despite multiple campaigns and a price drop

Growth is driven by acquisition, not loyalty

✅ What’s Good

Campaigns are effective at driving users

Walk-in users show strong product-market fit

The problem is clearly identifiable, not ambiguous

C. WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT?
📌 Key Insight

For B2C apps, a 5–7% monthly churn rate is generally considered healthy.
A 10% churn rate is dangerous.

This indicates that the problem is not primarily a marketing issue, but a strategic and product issue.

✅ Recommendations

Reduce Campaign Spend

Limit campaigns to Campaign A only

Eliminate underperforming campaigns that drive low-quality users

Shift Focus to Walk-In Users

Prioritize organic acquisition

Nurture walk-in users through onboarding, engagement, and retention strategies

These users represent the right target market, not just volume

Reallocate Effort from Acquisition to Retention

Improve early-stage user experience

Focus on activation and habit formation in the first 30 days

Retention improvements will have a larger impact than adding more users

🧠 Final Takeaway

The business is growing users but losing customers faster than it can sustain.
Until retention is fixed, scaling acquisition will only amplify the problem.

Cohort analysis reveals not just what is happening, but why growth is fragile, and where strategy must change.
