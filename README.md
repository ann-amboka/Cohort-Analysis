📊 COHORT ANALYSIS PROJECT
Retention, Campaign Impact, Events, and Business Sustainability

🔍 FRAMEWORK USED

This analysis follows a simple decision-making framework:

A.What happened?

B.Was it good or bad?

C.What should we do about it?

The analysis is structured across five key areas, incorporating campaigns, real-world events, and user behavior over time.

A. WHAT HAPPENED
1. Trend Analysis

Across all cohorts, retention decreased by approximately 10% every month.
This represents an average loss of 10,000 users per month.

The decline is consistent across cohorts, indicating a system-wide retention problem, not a cohort-specific issue.

2. Impact of Business Events

Three major events occurred during the analysis period:

Product launch

Price drop

System outage

Key Observations

>The product launch did not produce a sustained improvement in retention.

>Despite the price drop, sign-ups and active users showed no meaningful increase.

>The system outage negatively affected engagement but did not change the overall churn pattern.

Insight

The price drop failed to attract new users or improve retention, suggesting that pricing was not the core barrier.
For a new product, this indicates that value perception and product experience matter more than discounts.

3. Identifying High-Value Customers

High-value customers are(organic) users, not campaign-driven users.

Compared to users acquired through campaigns, organic users:

Engage more frequently

Stay active longer

Show stronger long-term retention

These users demonstrate clear product-market fit.

4. Measuring Campaign Effectiveness

Three campaigns were analyzed.

Campaign A and Campaign B were the most effective

Higher acquisition volumes

Stronger first-month retention

Campaign C consistently underperformed

Lower retention

Lower long-term value

While campaigns successfully drove sign-ups, retention beyond the first month declined sharply.

5. Tracking Customer Changes

User counts declined every month across all cohorts, regardless of:

Campaign exposure

Events

Acquisition source

This confirms that churn is persistent and structural.

6. Forecasting Business Performance

Based on historical trends:

A 10% monthly decline is likely to continue

If unchanged, this trajectory is not sustainable

Growth driven purely by acquisition will continue to leak users.

B. WAS IT GOOD OR BAD?

❌ What’s Bad

Users drop every month across all cohorts

Campaigns and price drops fail to improve long-term retention

Acquisition growth masks deeper retention issues

✅ What’s Good

Campaigns A and B are effective at acquisition

Organic users show strong engagement and loyalty

The core problems are clearly measurable and diagnosable

C. WHAT SHOULD WE DO ABOUT IT?

📌 Strategic Insight

For B2C apps, a 5–7% monthly churn rate is generally healthy.
A 10% churn rate is dangerous.

This is not a marketing problem.
It is a strategy and retention problem.

✅ Recommendations
1. Reallocate Campaign Spend

Retain Campaign A

Maintain Campaign B selectively

Stop or reduce Campaign C

Redirect Campaign C resources toward organic user nurturing

2. Prioritize Organic (Walk-In) Users

Organic users are the highest-value segment

Invest in onboarding, engagement, and retention for this group

Focus on activation and habit formation rather than discounts

3. Shift Focus from Discounts to Value

Price drops did not increase acquisition

Improve:

~~Core feature clarity

~~Early user experience

~~Retention improvements will outperform acquisition spend

🧠 FINAL TAKEAWAY

The business is acquiring users successfully but failing to retain them.

Until retention improves:

More campaigns will only increase churn volume

Discounts will not fix the underlying issue

Cohort analysis reveals where growth is breaking and where strategy must change.
